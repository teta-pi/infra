# Roadmap — TETA+PI development plan

This is our **canonical development plan** and task queue. The manager session keeps
the *status* current; the owner only **adds** to it. Ordered by what unblocks the
most; each backlog item is sized for one focused session.

Status legend: ✅ done · 🔄 in progress · ⏳ queued/blocked · 🔴 blocker · 🟠 important · 🟡 minor.

---

## Current sprint — numbered directions, sub-numbered tasks
Naming: `TTPI · <n> <direction> · <n.m> <task>` (see `docs/workflow.md`). Directions:
**1 backend · 2 mcp · 3 frontend (product UI) · 4 db · 5 devops · 6 manager · 7 github · 8 analytics · 9 server · 10 landing (promo) · 11 backoffice · 12 wordpress (plugin) · 13 gtm (autonomous go-to-market) · 14 camera (PI Camera product) · 15 security (standing red-team)**. Historical ✅ work
(pre-numbering: /auth/register removal, resolve_intent enrich, product metrics,
share button, landing pricing, TWIRA embedding code) lives in `docs/changelog.md`.
File ownership is disjoint so sessions never collide in git.

| n.m | Session (chat title) | Task | Status | Worktree / owns files |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | `1 backend · 1.1 fix private-block leak` | close 🟡 leak in `GET /businesses/{id}/blocks` — owner sees all, others only `is_public` | ✅ done 2026-07-12, PR #10 | `routes/blocks.py` |
| 1.2 | `1 backend · 1.2 registry search logging` | append-only request log in `services/registry/*` → unlocks `registry_search_health` | ⚪ queued | `services/registry/*`, new migration |
| 1.3 | `1 backend · 1.3 verification methods` | **verification rework** (`docs/verification-rework.md`): decouple entity creation from registry (L0 free); registry → optional method; NEW email-control + domain-ownership methods; brand↔legal link endpoint + public disclosure. Document upload: NO backend | ✅ done 2026-07-12, PR #15 | `routes/businesses.py`, `routes/auth.py` (reuse), new `services/verification/*` |
| 1.4 | `1 backend · 1.4 TWIRA source_weight` | per-method trust weights (registry/email/domain/document) feeding T-component; account for the weak email-domain binding noted in known-issues (1.3 review) | ✅ done 2026-07-12, PR #17 (registry 1.0 > document 0.85 dormant > domain 0.75 > email 0.5) | `api/app/twira/*` |
| 1.5 | `1 backend · 1.5 rename resets registry status` | manager-review finding on PR #15: `update_business` keeps `registry_status="verified"` after a rename — reset to `unverified` on name change (see known-issues) | ⚪ queued · small | `routes/businesses.py` |
| 1.6 | `1 backend · 1.6 media path traversal fix` | 🔴 audit #1: `GET /media/local/{file_id}/{filename}` serves files with NO auth and NO path containment — resolve + `is_relative_to(_UPLOAD_DIR)` check. **Most exposed finding, live on prod — fix before anything else touches media** | 🔴 **TOP PRIORITY** · tiny | `routes/media.py` |
| 1.7 | `1 backend · 1.7 verification hygiene bundle` | audit #6 (PATCH keeps `agent_endpoint_verified` after endpoint change → reset), #7 (unauthenticated SSRF-prone `/verify-endpoint` → auth/rate-limit the fetch), #13 (Redis `GETDEL` for code confirm). Same family as 1.5 — can be one session with it | ⚪ queued · small | `routes/businesses.py`, `routes/endpoint_verification.py`, `services/verification/*` |
| 1.8 | `1 backend · 1.8 stop GET-writes; recompute level on write` | audit #8: GETs mutate `updated_at` via `_compute_verification_level` on tracked ORM + unconditional commit; level-filtered search stale until random GET. Persist level reactively on the writes that change it | ⚪ queued | `routes/businesses.py`, `core/database.py` (careful) |
| 1.9 | `1 backend · 1.9 wire bitcoin timestamping` | audit #9: upload routes call a no-op stub, real `submit_bitcoin_timestamp` has zero call sites, confirm-check verifies `sha256("")` (wrong digest). Wire task + fix digest; existing beat/task context only, no new workers | ⚪ queued | `routes/media.py`, `workers/tasks/bitcoin.py` |
| 1.12 | `1 backend · 1.12 fix /businesses/{id}/preview 500` | 🔴 found in 2.5 live E2E: `GET /businesses/{id}/preview` (agent_preview) 500s → breaks 3/7 MCP tools. **Folded into 1.13** (same resolve→verify→profile chain) | ✅ folded into 1.13 (PR #39) | — |

| 2.5 | `2 mcp · 2.5 ecosystem hardening + listing` | **owner's end goal for direction 2: a fully working, debugged MCP in the Claude ecosystem (and others).** End-to-end test mcp.tetapi.dev from real clients (Claude Code/Desktop remote MCP, MCP Inspector), fix every protocol/manifest/tool-schema issue found; verify `/.well-known/mcp` + agent.json; then registry listings — official MCP registry, Claude connectors directory, other catalogs (actual submissions owner-approved). No new server features — hardening + distribution only, no sustained load. **Must absorb audit findings: 🔴 #2 (resolve_intent returns slug, every other tool wants UUID — flagship flow broken), 🟠 #5 (`verified_only` no-op), 🟡 #16 (`get_profile` renders undefined media fields), 🟡 #17 (`apiFetch` no timeout)** | ✅ done 2026-07-13, PR #31 (hardened: per-session transport, CORS, 15s timeout, server.json for listings; found new 🔴 backend /preview 500 → 1.12) | `mcp/src/*` (fixes only) + `routes/intent.py` (#2), `.well-known`, listing metadata, `docs/mcp.md` |

| 3.4 | `3 frontend · 3.4 verification methods UI` | rework UI (`docs/verification-rework.md`): method chooser (registry/email/domain active; document visible-DISABLED "Coming soon"); brand↔legal link UI; public disclosure of the link on profile + `/e/[slug]` | ✅ done 2026-07-13, PR #26 | claim/profile verification UI |
| 3.5 | `3 frontend · 3.5 claim page: no money` | mirror of 10.2 on app.tetapi.dev (owner 2026-07-13): remove the "$25 when billing launches — lock my founding price" checkbox from `/claim` (both form states), reframe to early access ("Join early access — be first"); `pay_ready` simply not sent (verify POST /claim tolerates absence — flag, don't fix backend). NOTE: coordinate with 3.4 — if 3.4 touches claim UI, land 3.4 first | 🟢 owner priority · after 3.4 lands if it touches claim | `web/src/app/claim/page.tsx` |
| 3.6 | `3 frontend · 3.6 auth store unification + real controls` | audit #10 (`/profile` never reads `useAuthStore` — login/settings users silently unauthenticated with false "Saved"), #11 (claim "domain email" step fully fake, `onClick={()=>{}}` + any 3 chars pass — wire to real `/verify/email/*` or hide; skip if 3.4 already wired it), #12 (no UI calls `businessApi.publish`/`setPrivacy` — build controls or remove dead surface) | ⚪ queued after 3.4 | `web/…/profile/page.tsx`, `login/settings/claim` auth wiring |
| 3.7 | `3 frontend · 3.7 registry-free registration flow` | **owner 2026-07-14: the claim flow still gates "Business" behind a registry search (`web/src/app/claim/page.tsx` step 1 runs Handelsregister/Companies House lookup when `isBusiness`), even though backend 1.3 already decoupled creation from registry. Owner couldn't find how to register without a registry.** Rework the flow after "Start": (1) FIRST screen = pick type — **Business/Organization** OR **Person** (Person sub-copy lists "journalist · actor · creator · other"); (2) THEN email; (3) THEN continue to create the entity immediately (L0, `registry_status=unverified`) — NO registry step in the path. Registry match becomes an OPTIONAL action LATER (on the profile, via the existing `POST /{id}/verify/registry` + the 3.4 method chooser), never a gate at creation. Keep the existing entity-kind→entity_type mapping but drop the registry-search branch from the create path | 🟢 owner priority · frontend-primary | `web/src/app/claim/page.tsx`, `useClaimStore` |
| 1.16 | `1 backend · 1.16 verify registration payload for 3.7` | small companion to 3.7: confirm `POST /businesses` + the claim endpoints accept the simplified type-first + email payload with ZERO registry fields required (1.3 already decoupled `create_business`, so likely already true — this is a verification + any-gap-fix task, not a rebuild). Fix anything that still assumes a registry_id/registry_data at create/claim time | 🟢 with 3.7 · likely tiny | `teta-pi/api` `routes/businesses.py`, `routes/claims.py` |
| 1.17 | `1 backend · 1.17 fix /search + /resolve-intent query filtering` | 🔴 **TOP PRIORITY — re-blocks GTM Phase 0.** Found live by 6.2 QA gate (2026-07-16, PR #7): `GET /search` returns the identical result set regardless of the `query` param (empty/exact-match/slug/nonsense all identical); `POST /resolve-intent` (backs `teta_resolve_intent`) returns empty for every query, including exact-name matches on entities that exist. Root-cause both — likely the same class of bug, query text not reaching the filter/match step — and fix. Re-verify live on prod (both raw curl and a real MCP client call) before closing | 🔴 blocks 6.2 re-run + GTM Phase 0 | `teta-pi/api` — search route + `services/registry`/`intent_graph` query-building, `routes/intent.py` |
| 4.1 | `4 db · 4.1 verification rework migration` | migration: `entities.legal_entity_id` nullable self-FK + extend `verification_events.event_type` enum (`email_verified`, `domain_verified`, `document_verified`); append-only trigger must survive | ✅ done 2026-07-12, PR #14 (migration ran on prod deploy) | new migration + models |

| 5.2 | `5 devops · 5.2 split plan (scope C)` | **owner decided 2026-07-13: scope C — full extraction to separate GitHub repos** (`api` / `web` / `mcp` / `landing` each own repo under `teta-pi`). This task = WRITE the C split plan into `docs/decisions.md` ONLY (zero code, zero deploy): repo layout, how git history is carried per component (`git filter-repo` subtree), per-repo CI/deploy workflow design, cross-repo contracts (web→api URL, mcp→api URL, shared types/agent.json), secrets/`.env` distribution, cutover order + rollback, and how the 512MB droplet deploy model changes. Execution is 5.3+ (gated on server upgrade — do NOT execute here) | ✅ done 2026-07-13, PR #41 — C plan in decisions.md (filter-repo per folder, infra meta-repo, per-repo deploy) | `docs/decisions.md`; worktree `ttpi-wt/5.2-split` (reset to main) |
| 5.3 | `5 devops · 5.3 execute repo split (C)` | execute the approved 5.2 plan: `git filter-repo` extraction per component, create `teta-pi/{api,web,mcp,landing,infra}` repos, per-repo deploy workflows + secrets, cutover in a merge freeze, rollback = re-enable mono deploy. **Prod-affecting (deploy rework + restarts)** | 🟢 unblocked — 9.1 resize landed 2026-07-13 (2GB/50GB); schedule cutover window | new repos + per-repo `.github/workflows/*` |
| 6.1 | `6 manager · 6.1 system-wide bug audit` | read-only sweep api/web/mcp/landing → 17 verified findings in `docs/known-issues.md`; spawned tasks 1.6-1.9, 3.6, 10.3 + absorbed into 2.5 | ✅ done 2026-07-13, PR #23 | `docs/known-issues.md` only |
| 6.2 | `6 manager · 6.2 pre-GTM core flow QA` | **GATE — owner 2026-07-14: must be green before starting GTM Phase 0.** Live E2E on prod, both as a human (web UI) and as an agent (MCP client), no mocking: (1) create a business entity (`POST /businesses`, no registry call — verify 1.3's decoupling still holds); (2) add a block to it; (3) upload a file/image to a block, confirm it lands (media_url/hash set, C2PA if applicable); (4) search finds the new entity — both `app.tetapi.dev` search UI AND `teta_search`/`teta_resolve_intent` via a real MCP client (Claude Code remote MCP or Inspector) return it; (5) `/e/[slug]` public page renders the block + media. Log every defect found into `docs/known-issues.md` with repro steps — do not silently fix in this session unless trivial; this is a QA sweep, not a fix session. Camera sync is OUT of scope here — see 14.2, runs in parallel | 🔴 **GATE FAILED (2026-07-16) — RED, not green.** Two new confirmed blockers on prod: `GET /search` ignores its `query` param entirely (same result set for any query, incl. exact-name and nonsense strings); `POST /resolve-intent`/`teta_resolve_intent` returns empty for every query tested, incl. exact-name matches. This fails step 4 outright. Steps 2/3 (add block, upload file/image) are **untested/blocked** — need an authenticated owner session and reading a login OTP out of a real inbox, which is out of scope for an agent to do on the owner's behalf. Step 1 (create-without-registry) confirmed still passing; step 5 partially confirmed (`/e/[slug]` renders the shell, but the probed entity has no blocks so block+media rendering is untested). Bonus: the previously-open `/businesses/{id}/preview` 500 (2.5 finding) is now confirmed FIXED. Full detail + exact repro in `docs/known-issues.md`. **Does not clear GTM Phase 0 — blockers need a backend session, then steps 2/3/5(media) need re-running with real login.** | read-only QA — `docs/known-issues.md` (new findings + one fix confirmation) |

## Coordination rules (so parallel sessions don't break each other)
- Each session touches **only its own files** (table above). Never edit another
  session's file.
- Shared-risk files: `web/src/lib/api.ts` (sessions 3 & 6) — **only append new
  functions at the end**, don't touch existing lines → merges cleanly.
- `routes/*` — each session takes its **own** file (auth / blocks / admin), never a
  peer's.
- Claude **commits + pushes automatically**; deploy is automatic on push to `main`.
  After each merge the **manager verifies on prod**.
- Each session ends with the `Done / Changed / Risk / Next` block and updates the
  matching `docs/*.md`.

(`pre-resize-2026-07-13`, restorable if ever needed). Post-resize verified:
RAM 1.9GB (798MB free, swap 0/2GB, was swapping 323MB at 458MB total before),
disk 6.8/48GB = 15% (was 78%), all services `active`, all 4 subdomains 200.
The sustained-load restriction below is LIFTED — 5.1, 5.3, Redis #12, SSE
streaming (2.3), 2.4 usage analytics are all clear to proceed on capacity
grounds (other gates, e.g. OpenAI billing for 5.1, may still apply).

## Blocked — waiting on keys / DNS (don't start until provided)
| Item | Needs | Effect when unblocked |
|---|---|---|
| Turn on TWIRA semantics (5.1) | `OPENAI_API_KEY` **billing unpaid (429)** — server capacity no longer blocks this | semantic search + `/resolve-intent` + block embeddings turn on |
| Resend domain verification (#11) | DNS on `tetapi.dev` (DKIM/SPF) | emails reach everyone, not just the owner inbox |
| Ukraine registry | `OPENDATABOT_API_KEY` | UA registry search works (verifier already written) |

## Backlog — ordered by what unblocks the most

### Now — fix what's broken (from known-issues)
1. ✅ **Persist profile blocks to the backend** — load entity+blocks on open, save
   add/edit/remove via the API. *(Done 2026-07-06, `6a022bb`. Reorder UI = session 3.)*
2. ✅ **Remove/gate `/auth/register`** — dead, unauthenticated. *(Done 2026-07-06.)*
3. 🔄 **Turn on TWIRA semantics** — embedding CODE merged 2026-07-11 (PR #3: embed on
   block create/update + `twira_backfill_block_embeddings` task). REMAINING: set
   `OPENAI_API_KEY` on the server `.env` (obtained 2026-07-06) + run the backfill.
   *(Devops session 7 — server-side only now.)*
   - 🟡 also open: `GET /businesses/{id}/blocks` leaks private blocks (session 2);
     in-memory rate-limit/lock assumes single worker → move to Redis before scaling (#12).

### Next — the MCP investment (owner's priority)
The differentiator: make TETA+PI the registry agents actually route through
(see `docs/mcp.md`).
4. ✅ **Enrich `teta_resolve_intent`** — returns `first_verified_at`, proof URLs, and the
   full T/I/P breakdown in a shape agents can rank on; adds `entity_types` +
   `min_trust` filters. *(Done, MCP 1.2.0, merged.)*
5. ⏳ **`teta_get_proof` depth** — include OTS status, btc_timestamp_depth, C2PA chain
   length so agents can set their own trust threshold. *(Not started — was bundled with
   the MCP session but only resolve_intent shipped.)*
6. **Agent-facing auth for MCP writes** — design how a verified agent authenticates
   to the MCP server (scoped `pk_live_` keys) before adding any write tools.
7. **Streaming / batched search** for large result sets over SSE.
8. **MCP usage analytics** — which tools agents call, latency, so we tune TWIRA
   weights from real `(query, clicked_entity)` pairs (the data moat closing).
   *(Bundle with the MCP session — it touches the MCP server; do not run parallel to #4/#5.)*

### Product — account & sharing
9. ✅ **"Share page" button** on `/profile` linking to `/e/[slug]` (+ copy link).
   Shown only when the entity is published. *(Done 2026-07-06.)*
10. **Sessions list with devices** — needs server-side session storage (JWT is
    stateless today); "log out everywhere" already works via token_version.
11. Resend domain verification so emails reach everyone. *(Blocked on DNS.)*
11b. **Camera capture → C2PA + OTS notarization** (session 5) — capture photo/video
     through the camera and run it through the EXISTING C2PA signing + OpenTimestamps
     pipeline (blocks already carry `c2pa_manifest` / `ots_proof`). Three use-cases:
     proof-of-creation (content made by a verified entity), proof-of-process (video
     verification of production / standards compliance), and copyright deposit
     (timestamp as priority evidence). Reuse the proof services — do not build a
     parallel pipeline. Scaffold capture UI as new files under `web/src/app/capture/`;
     plan first, then wire. *(Frontend + Backend.)*

### Back office — internal analytics
15. 🔄 **System metrics dashboard** (session 6) — on top of the existing `/admin/stats`
    (snapshot counters) and `/admin/analytics` (GoatCounter traffic), add: time-series
    trends (entity growth + verification_events per day), entities by `entity_type`,
    a claim → verified funnel, and registry search health (success rate / latency).
    Read-only aggregation, `require_admin` + audit, no new tables. MCP-usage analytics
    stays out of scope here (that is #8).

### Platform — scale readiness
12. 🟠 Move rate limiters + Handelsregister lock to Redis (unblocks multi-worker).
13. More US state registries (CA, TX, DE-state portals) via the `us_states.py` pattern.
14. Learned TWIRA weights (logistic regression on click logs) once MCP analytics exist (#8).
